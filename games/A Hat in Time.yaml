A Hat in Time:
  accessibility: items

  # Make all traps local when enabled.
  # Non-local traps typically have little effect in an async, with most being triggered upon loading into the game and
  # then being cleared upon dying in the spaceship hub area or entering a level.
  local_items:
    - Baby Trap
    - Laser Trap
    - Parade Trap

  ### Trigger control to allow harder options for filler-only asyncs ###
  trigger_harder_options:
    'true': 100
    'false': 0


  ### DLC trigger control ###
  # Players are probably going to have either no DLC or both DLC, though the DLC1 content is probably less popular to
  # play compared to the DLC2 content.
  trigger_dlc:
    no_dlc: 40 # Always Finale Goal
    dlc1_only: 10 # Always Finale Goal
    dlc2_only: 15 # 20% (3/15) chance of Finale Goal, 80% (12/15) chance of Rush Hour Goal
    both_dlc: 35 # 34.3% (12/35) chance of Finale Goal, 65.7% (23/35) chance of Rush Hour Goal

  ### ActRandomizer: false, StartingChapter trigger control ###
  # Chained trigger to choose StartingChapter with different weights and adjust chapter-specific options for the chosen
  # starting chapter with ActRandomizer: false.
  # A trigger changes this value when ActRandomizer is set to false.
  # Additional triggers then adjust the StartingChapter option and other options depending on this option's value when
  # it is set to something other than null.
  triggerchain_no_act_rando_StartingChapter: null

  ### Goal ###
  # Overridden by triggers, but these values match the summed trigger weights for each goal.
  EndGoal:
    finale: 65 # 40 have no DLCs enabled, 10 only have DLC1 enabled, 3 only have DLC2 enabled, 12 have both DLCs enabled
    rush_hour: 35 # 12 only have DLC2 enabled, 23 have both DLCs enabled

  ### Logic ###
  # Higher difficulties require additional game knowledge and skill. May be overridden by triggers.
  LogicDifficulty:
    normal: 50
    # Recommended for players that have 100%-ed vanilla and are good at platformers. Most of the tricks can be performed
    # with only extra game knowledge, except Subcon Well without Hookshot, which is execution heavy and may require
    # practice.
    moderate: 5
    # Hard starts requiring basic speedrun tech (Sprint Double Jump) and more obscure and technically demanding tricks.
    hard: 1
  # Re-rolled with a chance of "scooter", by triggers, when LogicDifficulty is set to moderate or higher.
  CTRLogic: time_stop_only
  # Makes the basic melee attack do nothing, being unable to activate Dweller Bells, Faucets etc.
  # Makes the Umbrella item more logic relevant.
  # Also makes the Brewing Hat more logic relevant because it can be used to activate/damage some objects that would
  # otherwise require the Umbrella to hit.
  # Having this off can be annoying in some cases because the player loses control of Hat Kid as she recoils in pain
  # for a couple of seconds after punching something with her bare hands.
  UmbrellaLogic:
    'false': 50
    'true': 50
  # To reduce confusion, all skips are disabled by default and then only enabled using triggers for higher logic
  # difficulties where the skips are applicable.
  NoPaintingSkips: 'true'
  NoTicketSkips: 'true'

  ### Shuffles ###
  # The chance of having every shuffle option enabled is about 33.3%.
  # Shuffle zipline unlocks into the item pool. All ziplines are unlocked from the start when disabled.
  ShuffleAlpineZiplines:
    'false': 30
    'true': 70
  # Adds additional checks to Purple Time Rifts and additional junk to the item pool.
  ShuffleStorybookPages:
    'false': 15
    'true': 85
  # Shuffle the items that unlock acts in Chapter 3 into the item pool.
  # Triggers reduce the chance of a Chapter 3 start when this is enabled.
  ShuffleActContracts:

  # Breaks up the main Subcon Forest area into 4 parts.

  ### Badge Seller/Mafia Boss Shop ###
  MinPonCost: 75
  MaxPonCost: 300
  BadgeSellerMinItems: 4
  BadgeSellerMaxItems: 10

  ### Topology ###
  # Insanity is more likely to result in an early BK and a smaller Sphere 1. It also enables the possibility of an
  # important Act being behind a Purple Time Rift entrances, which typically makes a seed much worse and enables the
  # possibility of nested Time Rift entrances.
  ActRandomizer:
    'false': 8 # Effectively only chapter and item randomization, not a common choice.
    light: 51 # light is the default option
    insanity: 41
  # Removes the possibility of being walled for a long time by The Illness Has Spread (when ShuffleAlpineZiplines is
  # enabled) and Rush Hour (when EnableDLC2 is enabled with EndGoal is set to finale).
  FinaleShuffle:
    'false': 5
    'true': 2
  # Chapter 3 chance is reduced, by triggers, when ShuffleActContracts is enabled.
  # StartingChapter is rerolled, by triggers, with different odds when ActRandomizer is disabled.
  StartingChapter:
    '1': 38
    '2': 32
    '3': 23 # With ShuffleActContracts disabled, a Subcon Forest act still needs to be found to get contracts.
    '4': 7 # Only has a single act available to start with, and the second is a Finale with many access requirements.

  ### Chapter Costs ###
  # The average cost of the first unlockable chapter is (LowestChapterCost + ChapterCostIncrement * 2)/ 2.
  LowestChapterCost: random-range-middle-4-6
  # Overridden, by triggers, depending on the number of Time Pieces in the pool.
  HighestChapterCost: 35
  # Each enabled DLC adds more Time Pieces to the item pool, but they also each add an extra chapter, so the cost
  # increment and min difference do not need to be adjusted depending on the number of Time Pieces in the pool.
  # The way chapter costs work is complicated.
  # Where:
  #   f(n) = chapter cost of nth unlockable chapter
  #   f(-1) = 0 (the starting chapter that does not need to be unlocked)
  # The hard minimum cost for chapters is:
  #   f_min(0): LowestChapterCost
  #   f_min(1): f(0) + ChapterCostIncrement
  #   f_min(n): f(n-1) + max(ChapterCostIncrement, ChapterCostMinDifference)
  # The hard maximum cost for chapters is:
  #   f_max(0): max(LowestChapterCost, ChapterCostIncrement) + ChapterCostIncrement
  #   f_max(1): f(0) + ChapterCostIncrement * 2
  #   f_max(n): f(n-1) + max(ChapterCostIncrement * 2, ChapterCostMinDifference)
  # Costs are clamped to <= HighestChapterCost
  # From running simulations of chapter costs, the average chapter cost starts at roughly the average of the minimum
  # and maximum for the first chapter and each subsequent chapter gradually gets closer to the maximum.
  # Ideally, the difference between chapter costs starts high and reduces as each chapter is unlocked because as the
  # number of Time Pieces in the pool decreases, the time between receiving Time Pieces should get longer.
  ChapterCostIncrement: random-range-middle-4-7
  ChapterCostMinDifference: random-range-middle-4-6
  # Overridden, by triggers, depending on the number of Time Pieces in the pool.
  FinalChapterMinCost: 30
  # Overridden, by triggers, depending on the number of Time Pieces in the pool.
  FinalChapterMaxCost: 35
  # Increases the number of Time Pieces in the pool, which is factored into the chapter costs.
  # This value is reduced automatically depending on which DLCs are not enabled. Reduced to a max of 10 with only DLC2,
  # a max of 6 with only DLC1 and always 0 with no DLCs.
  MaxExtraTimePieces: 16

  ### DLC1 ###
  EnableDLC1: 'false' # Overridden by triggers.
  # Send checks by doing tasks in Ship Shape. Adds junk to the item pool for each check.

    'false': 5
    'true': 4
  TasksanityTaskStep:

  # Don't want to make `TasksanityTaskStep * TasksanityCheckCount` high because the level gets very long and more
  # difficult.
  # Overridden by triggers when TasksanityTaskStep is 2 or 3 to produce a similar number of total tasks.
  TasksanityCheckCount: random-range-8-20
  ExcludeTour: 'false' # Overridden by triggers to almost always be 'true' when EndGoal is set to 'finale'.
  # Setting this to a different value than `TasksanityTaskStep * TasksanityCheckCount` can be confusing because either
  # the checks are completed before the level is completed, or the player must re-enter Ship Shape multiple times to get
  # all the checks.
  ShipShapeCustomTaskGoal: 0 # When 0, set automatically to `TasksanityTaskStep * TasksanityCheckCount`.

  ### Death Wish (DLC1) ###
  # Death Wish is enabled with a low chance when DLC1 is enabled.
  # Completing the main objective of a Death Wish contract with Peace and Tranquillity active counts for completing the
  # checks, so the skill level required to complete Death Wish is lower than would be expected. This can be quite slow,
  # however, because Peace and Tranquillity can only be activated after failing a Contract a number of times and
  # activating it costs Pons (farmable currency).
  EnableDeathWish: 'false'

    # must be completed in order.

    ### Randomized option cleanup ###
    # If a randomized option has no effect because an option it depends on has been disabled, set it to a non-randomized
    # value, typically its default.
    # This aims to make it easier for people reading the spreadsheet to identify which options have been enabled.
