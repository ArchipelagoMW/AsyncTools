SMZ3:
  sm_logic: # This option selects what kind of logic to use for item placement inside
    #    Super Metroid.
    #
    #    Normal - Normal logic includes only what Super Metroid teaches players
    #    itself. Anything that's not demonstrated in-game or by the intro cutscenes
    #    will not be required here.
    #
    #    Hard - Hard logic is based upon the "no major glitches" ruleset and
    #    includes most tricks that are considered minor glitches, with some
    #    restrictions. You'll want to be somewhat of a Super Metroid veteran for
    #    this logic.
    #
    #    See https://samus.link/information for required moves.
